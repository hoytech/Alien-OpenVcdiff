=head1 NAME

Alien::OpenVcdiff - build and install google open-vcdiff delta encoding library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Alien::OpenVcdiff;

    system(Alien::OpenVcdiff::vcdiff_binary() . " encode -dictionary file1 -target file2 -json");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package configures, builds, and installs Google's L<open-vcdiff|http://code.google.com/p/open-vcdiff/>. This library and command-line utility implements L<RFC 3284|http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3284.html>, "The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data". This RFC specifies a file format for delta encoding and can be thought of as a diff/patch equivalent for binary data.

The C<vcdiff> command-line utility binary's location can be found by calling C<Alien::OpenVcdiff::vcdiff_binary()> after the package has been loaded.

Although the binary might come in handy sometimes, the primary purpose of this module is to install the C<libvcdenc.so> and C<libvcddec.so> shared libraries so that they can be used by L<Vcdiff>.
