=head1 NAME

Alien::OpenVcdiff - Build and install Google's open-vcdiff delta encoding library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Command-line utility

    use Alien::OpenVcdiff;

    say Alien::OpenVcdiff::vcdiff_binary();
    ## /usr/local/share/perl/5.16.2/auto/share/dist/Alien-OpenVcdiff/bin/vcdiff

    system(Alien::OpenVcdiff::vcdiff_binary() . " encode -dictionary file1 -target file2 -json");

=head2 Library interface

    my $openvcdiff = Alien::OpenVcdiff->new;

    my $cflags = $openvcdiff->cflags;
    ## "-I/usr/local/share/perl/5.16.2/auto/share/dist/Alien-OpenVcdiff/include/google"

    my $libs = $openvcdiff->libs;
    ## "-L/usr/local/share/perl/5.16.2/auto/share/dist/Alien-OpenVcdiff/lib -lvcdcom -lvcddec -lvcdenc"

The above methods are inherited from L<Alien::Base> which has worked really well so far except with C<$cflags> I found I had to strip the "google" off the end of the include directory.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package configures, builds, and installs Google's L<open-vcdiff|http://code.google.com/p/open-vcdiff/>. This library and its associated command-line utility C<vcdiff> implement L<RFC 3284|http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3284.html>, "The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data Format". This RFC specifies a file format for delta encoding and can be thought of as a diff/patch equivalent for binary data (or any kind of data really).

The C<vcdiff> command-line utility binary's location can be found by calling C<Alien::OpenVcdiff::vcdiff_binary()> after the package has been loaded.

Although the binary might come in handy sometimes, the primary purpose of this module is to install the C<libvcdenc.so> and C<libvcddec.so> shared libraries so that they can be used by the L<Vcdiff> module. Nothing from C<open-vcdiff> is installed globally -- it's all contained in the perl auto directory.
